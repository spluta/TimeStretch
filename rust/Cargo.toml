description = "Implements a phase randomized Real FFT time stretch algorithm, the NessStretch, which splits the original sound file into 1-10 discrete frequency bands, and uses a decreasing frame size to correspond to increasing frequency, thus doing a excellent job of resolving shorter, noisier high-frequency sounds and creating rich, lush low frequency pads."
